# The CVU RoboHawks' (5741) FtcRobotController

This repository contains the codebase for the CVU RoboHawks, forked from the public FTC SDK for the 2022-2023 competition season. We have more documentation in our TeamCode folder and [the README there](/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/README.md). We primarily use the `dev` branch for development though, so the README and the code on that branch will be more up-to-date.
